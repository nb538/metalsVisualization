# CS450-Team15

This is the project repository for Team 15 of CS 450 for the fall semester of 2024 at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.

## Project Summary

In summary, our group has been tasked with producing a dachboard with visualization for the purpose of end-user consumption.
The project is designed to apply visualization techniques and methods learned over the course fo the semester to extract data from raw files and arrange in such a way as to allow any user to draw utility from them.
For this purpose our group chose to visualize the metals market over the last 30 years to show trends to the user and account for the effects of inflation on these trends.
The utiltiy for the end user is that one may observe the historical data of the market and, from these visualizations, make financial decisions regarding whether or not they will enter or leave the metals market.
This is a concept project intended to showcase learned techniques in visualizations and the ability to make use of the React framework and D3 library to manipulate real data.
